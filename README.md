# SchoolPhysicals
School Physicals  https://integrityhealthforwellness.com/school-physicals/  As part of our array of annual and semi-annual physicals, we provide school physicals for kids and teens ready for another year of learning!   Doctors recommend having a physical every annually for children over five years old.  Many states and counties require a physical to attend school. This is to ensure your child and all other students are up-to-date on vaccines and shots, as well as safeguarding against any health related issues that may arise during the school year.
